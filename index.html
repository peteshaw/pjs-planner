  <hr>
  Every day the men and women of FEMA do great things in support of disaster survivors, first responders, our Nation,
  and one another. You Rock! is a means by which any FEMA employee can recognize a FEMA colleague for good work in near
  real-time.
  <br><br>
We encourage you to use You Rock! to show your colleagues that you appreciate what they do and to help create a culture of recognition and community in the FEMA workforce.
