So here is the pattern.  I start the day with intentions and plans and really want to get a bunch of stuff done, but then I just... don't do it.  I try to begin, but when something novel or interesting, or perhaps with some urgency comes along, and I start doing that.  One of the funnier things about this pattern is that frequeently at the end of the day, when I begin some task without the danger of having to do it for 6 or 7 hours, I get sucked into the groove of the specific item I am working on.
