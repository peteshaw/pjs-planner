So here is the pattern.  I start the day with intentions and plans and really want to get a bunch of stuff done, but then I just... don't do it.  I try to begin, but when something novel or interesting, or perhaps with some urgency comes along, and I start doing that.  One of the funnier things about this pattern is that frequeently at the end of the day, when I begin some task without the danger of having to do it for 6 or 7 hours, I get sucked into the groove of the specific item I am working on.   

So this is the issue, or at least one of the issues.  How can I get myself started in the morning on time?  I do remember reading that it is more important to have a system than a plan.  And a system is more of a bunch of "if this happens then do this" kind of things.  (Just remembered to set the pomo timer to 15 minutes).  

So to start off, I always begin a new day with a page in my journal.  In that I will write down things I want to get done today, and provide a way of keeping track of commitments, items in my schedule, and things I want to do. 

For today, I am going to be happy if I am able to just do my journaling, which I am working on now.  Pushing it to github as a way of breaking through the work vpn.  I could just email it to myself, but this is easier.  I want to get in the habit of just writing until I can empty my head of everything that is on my mind currently.  

I want to be productive at my job.  I want to be healthy.  I want to live a meaningful life.  I want to be able to make good use of whatever is left of my time on this earth.  I keep repeating these things and yet I am alwasy unable toreach them beyond a certain point.  I need to create a system for me to be able to accomplish these things.
