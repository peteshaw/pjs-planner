    So now after all the other bullshit with Sam's apartment now they are hitting us with some charges for repairs, that were done on the other apartments.  I looked at the lease, and I don't think they can charge us for repairs unless there is some kind of negligence.  I also don't remember being emailed about any of these repairs, or that we would be charged for them.  So I am at a loss here on what is going on and what to do about it.
