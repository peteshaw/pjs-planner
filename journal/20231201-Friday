 JOURNAL

 Well it is friday and it has been an uneventful week.  What do I want to write about today.  Lets start with weight loss, my ongoing losing battle.  I probably should go back to vlogging on tiktok, because otherwise I am not making any progress, despite the large number of peptides I am putting into my system.  Perhaps I need to start working with a trainer or a nutritionist.  Or maybe even just working with that new AI coach I have installed on my ipad. 

 A b ig problem for me is that my mind jumps around so much it becomes difficult to settle on a single course of action.
